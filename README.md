OSV.dev analysis
===

## Setup

### Data

Run `make data/swh.db` to fetch the data from OSV and add it to the database, creating a csv file at `data/osv.csv`.

### `graph-tool`
#### Shell
The shell is used to colorize graphs using parquet file and is not optimized for large graphs.

#### Requirements
The shell and more specifically `utils/pq_graph.py` require `graph-tool`. As this is a package not available through `pip`, a docker image is used for this module.

#### Data
The shell uses a parquet file for the commit graph and a csv for the vulnerabilities.

#### Run
To run these files, run `make build` to build the docker image, then `make shell` or `make src/xxx.py` to run it in the docker container.


### gRPC
#### `graph.py`
This script will create a database of commit <-> vulnerability associations using a gRPC server and the vulnerabilities csv loaded into a sqlite table.

#### Requirements
The swh.graph module can raise errors during install, requiring `postgresql` and [cmph](https://github.com/zvelo/cmph/blob/master/INSTALL) installed.
These packages will be installed in the docker container, but if you want to avoid using it, you need to install them yourself.

#### Run
Simply run `make colorize` or `src/graph.py`.
